# fetch request to curl

This module is based on [http-to-curl](https://github.com/drgx/http-to-curl). Use it to generate curl requests with the inputs you would usually use for javascripts fetch. However it does not patch any modules like http-to-curl. It is just a wrapper to generate the curl string.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add fetch-to-curl
```

## Usage

```js
import fetchToCurl from 'fetch-to-curl';

const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "BASIC SOMEBASE64STRING"
  }
  method: 'get'
};
//Log yopur request
console.log(fetchToCurl(url, options));
//Do your request
fetch(url, options);

//Output
curl "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1" -X GET -H "Authorization: BASIC SOMEBASE64STRING"
```
