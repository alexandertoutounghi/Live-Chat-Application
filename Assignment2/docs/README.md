## Description of the application

This application is a small web application which simulates a Message Board System.
The message board is an online discussion website 
where users hold conversations in the form of posted messages. 
The messages are normally longer than chat messages 
and may have attachments.<br />
<br />
Compared with the last assigment, we implemented following parts:
1) The Message Board Business Layer
2) The Persistence Layer
3) The File Download Servlet
